\section{Conclusion}
We have presented an approach to classifying vocal diseases using an ensemble of different approaches. We use a custom ensemble consisting of supervised, semi-supervised and multiple-instance learning methods. We use a pipeline architecture to separate normal samples from vocal palsy, neoplasm and phonotrauma samples. Our approach was able to obtain a sensitivity of 89.4\% and specificity of 76\% on the test data with a UAR score of 60.67\%. In future work, if we obtain the labeled test set, we would like to analyze the errors of our approach to improve it further.
