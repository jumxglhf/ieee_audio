\subsection{Background:}
	Vocal classification is perceived as one of the challenging tasks in medical field. Many researchers did meaningful work on designing optimal classifiers which can help diagnose vocal diseases from patient's voice record. Some vocal diseases such as neoplasm are notoriously hard to distinguish solely by listening due to noise and subtlety of symptom. 
\subsection{Related work:}
	Vahid Majidnezhad tried artificial neural network with Mel-Frequency-Cepstral-Coefficients as feature vectors to achieve optimal result on vocal pathology classfication\cite{b5}. P. Kukharchik also used wavelet transform with support vector machine to optimize classifiers' performance\cite{b4}. However, there are not any researcher who has tried multiple-ensemble classification and divide mul-class classification into multiple binary classification in vocal pathology classification.
